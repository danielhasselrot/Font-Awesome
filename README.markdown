### Generating iOS tab bar icons
generate.py is a script for converting Font Awesome icons to iOS tab bar icons.
ImageMagick should be in the PATH and called 'convert', and the output is written
to the directory 'png'.

The script itself is under the simplified BSD license. The build products, a
derivative work, are under the same license as the original contribution by 
Dave Gandy, CC BY 3.0.  If you find the iOS tab bar icons useful, please consider
